## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
### How to enable No mention feature
Head to [src/misc/config.json](https://github.com/Carbowix/Cleve/blob/master/src/misc/config.json#L19) and edit **"noMention"** value to `true`

- **IMPORANT**: In-order for this feature to work, you will have to enable [MessageContent Privileged Intent](https://autocode.com/discord/threads/what-are-discord-privileged-intents-and-how-do-i-enable-them-tutorial-0c3f9977/) in your discord bot application. Otherwise it will produce and error like the following:
<img src="./src/misc/images/error.png">

### How to enable Direct Messages feature
Head to [src/misc/config.json](https://github.com/Carbowix/Cleve/blob/master/src/misc/config.json#L20) and edit **"directMessage"** value to `true`

### Bot not replying / API error
It most likely either you failed to to follow the [installation](#installation--setup) instructions correctly or Brainshop.ai API is [down](https://rapidapi.com/Acobot/api/brainshop-ai/discussions)

### Invalid Token even when loaded though .env file
It is most likely the `.env` file is either still named `.env.example` which you should change to `.env` or the file is not in the `src` folder.
Otherwise your bot token is actually invalid.

### Unexpected Token 'S' at position 0
If you are getting that error, it is most likely you are using `replit` as your hosting environment and unfortunately the API of brainshop does not support it and considers it as spam request. Your likely solution to find another hosting platform.
